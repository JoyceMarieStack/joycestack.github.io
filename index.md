# What I Built — Experiments & Prototypes in Docs-as-Code

## 1. Quick Win: Pre-commit Documentation Checks  
**Goal:** Automate enforcement of documentation standards before code merges.  
**Experiment:** Built a simple Python pre-commit hook in 3 days.  
**Outcome:** Adopted by a team; helps catch documentation issues early.  
**Impact:** *Initial adoption; impact to be measured over time.*

## 2. Starting Small: AI Coach for Repo Setup  
**Goal:** Reduce onboarding friction by automating repo documentation scaffolding.  
**Experiment:** Created an AI-powered bot to bootstrap new repos with templates.  
**Outcome:** Used successfully by a team to standardize initial docs.  
**Impact:** *Early results; next step is measuring team adoption.*

## 3. Testing Standards: Vale Rulesets for Content Quality  
**Goal:** Automate content linting to improve docs quality.  
**Experiment:** Developed Vale rulesets based on writing guidelines.  
**Outcome:** Pilot in CI/CD pipelines.  
**Impact:** *Initial testing; scaling and impact assessment ongoing.*

## 4. Organizing Knowledge: Backstage TechDocs Projects  
**Goal:** Improve discoverability of scattered documentation.  
**Experiment:** Organized existing docs into Backstage TechDocs.  
**Outcome:** Created a centralized view of documentation.  
**Impact:** *Foundation laid; future measurement of usage.*

## 5. Exploring Documentation Frameworks  
**Goal:** Define a reusable structure for documentation.  
**Experiment:** Piloted Diátaxis framework and The Good Docs Project templates across projects.  
**Outcome:** Published standards on Backstage.  
**Impact:** *Early adoption; measuring cultural change next.*

## 6. Building a Learning Loop: Sharing and Community  
**Goal:** Foster a culture of documentation excellence.  
**Experiment:** Launched a documentation community of practice and published blogs.  
**Outcome:** Engaged a small group, shared best practices.  
**Impact:** *Initial engagement; scaling efforts planned.*
